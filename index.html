                        Outside of work, Generative AI can generate different new content according to the needs of users, and this model has already been applied to people's lives. Such as education, health care, banking, marketing and other fields. Moreover, the use threshold of this ai tool is very low, which is easy for users to learn and use, and can greatly meet the needs of users, greatly facilitating People's Daily life.

                    <p>
                        While the increase in productivity of artificial intelligence has facilitated some jobs, it has also threatened quite a few. For example, in simple manufacturing, we input programs into robots, and they will execute them at high speed, and their production efficiency is much higher than that of humans. Moreover, the technology of ai to generate pictures also poses a great threat to the artist community, and studies have shown that the high efficiency of ai has caused a large number of unemployed cartoonists.

                        One of the biggest problems is "Copyright", which means the author's right to protect their own works from training AI tools. Nowadays, there are some developers use artworks to train their AI tools without the authors' consent. These AI products will have the authors' styles, but this behavior is an infrigement on the author's originality, and if the authors' creative styles are used in illegal purposes, such as war, it will bring greater harm to the oringinal author.

                        <p>
                            Today, generative artificial intelligence has been applied in all walks of life and penetrated into all levels of society.
                        </p>
                        <li class="con">First of all, with the convenient algorithms behind it and its efficient learning ability, generative artificial intelligence has been combined with many cutting-edge technologies and models, and has been widely used in finance, computers, medical, education, art and other industries, changing the The original production conditions have achieved high-speed production, bringing extremely rich economic benefits. These same products are also used in people's daily lives. With the help of artificial intelligence, people's lives are more convenient and the quality has been greatly improved.</li>
                        <li class="con">However, generative artificial intelligence still has major drawbacks, which will bring about great social problems. For example, with the development of artificial intelligence, some jobs will gradually be replaced by artificial intelligence, which will cause unemployment for some people, and the rights of these people need to be protected. Similarly, in the training process of generative artificial intelligence, a large number of existing works need to be collected as materials. However, a considerable number of works are currently used in training without authorization, and the legitimate rights and interests of the original authors are not protected.</li>
                        <p>
                            Now we need to improve our discrimination capabilities when using AI and use them as tools instead of using them as a shortcut to replace humans. The development of generative artificial intelligence still has a long way to go and requires the efforts of professionals.
